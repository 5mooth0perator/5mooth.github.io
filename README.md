## Robinhood is people's electronic cash

Robinhood is cryptocurrency of Brazilian origin, just like Bitcoin but more anonymous and privacy centric with opaque and more analysis resistant blockchain.

It is people's electronic cash, not connected to government or officials.

Robinhood is a fully secure and anonymous cryptocurrency. Built from the ground up to ensure anonymity, transactions cannot be linked to a single sender.

Cryptocurrency is about the decentralization of the financial sector, removing people’s dependence on third party institutions.

Robinhood is the natural next step in this journey, giving us all the power to make truly anonymous financial transactions.

**We have builds for Windows, Apple, and Ubuntu Linux**. If you prefer **source code**, you can find that [here](https://github.com/5mooth0perator, but you should also contact us [here](https://t.me/joinchat/DqnU2RIxEDlVlxLdLFrn7g) because we're looking for people like you to join us.

### Why Robinhood?

### The story

Too many projects are bringing in **too much funding** despite most having **no damn product**. We figured, _"why not do the whole thing in reverse? Start with a fun project, make it as simple and accessible as possible, and let it grow on its own."_

We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, **the value will create itself**. If you think we're wrong, we're happy to [talk](https://t.me/joinchat/DqnU2RIxEDlVlxLdLFrn7g) about it.
