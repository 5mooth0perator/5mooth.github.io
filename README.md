### Manifesto

#### An open-source technology and concepts for the cryptocurrencies of the future

In a mass surveillance world we develop and promote new approaches to further decentralize
and emancipate cryptocurrencies. We use advanced mathematical analysis and innovative ideas to empower end-users with true privacy, both financial and personal.

We share our ideas to shift the current global paradigm through cryptography and egalitarianism.

### What is Robinhood

Robinhood is a fully secure and anonymous cryptocurrency. Built from the ground up to ensure anonymity, transactions cannot be linked to a single sender.

Cryptocurrency is about the decentralization of the financial sector, removing people’s dependence on third party institutions.

Robinhood is the natural next step in this journey, giving us all the power to make truly anonymous financial transactions.

#### Egalitarian proof of work

#### Adaptive limits

### The Nottinghamshire Blockchain Alliance

We predict that cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technologies like it will become far more significant over the next few years than is expected by most of our similarly irrelevant pundits — and this will, no doubt, turn out to be just as much of an understatement as anything else that has been written on the subject.

The Nottinghamshire Blockchain Alliance is a community was founded by 5mooth0perator in the county of Brazópolis, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

The Nottinghamshire Blockchain Alliance was formed to bring together people who are interested in getting involved in blockchain solutions.

The Nottinghamshire Blockchain Alliance community aims to help each other advance our ambitions in blockchain spaces.
