## Robinhood is people's electronic cash

Robinhood is cryptocurrency of Brazilian origin, just like Bitcoin but more anonymous and privacy centric with opaque and more analysis resistant blockchain.

It is people's electronic cash, not connected to government or officials.

**We have builds for Windows, Apple, and Ubuntu Linux**. If you prefer **source code**, you can find that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/), but you should also contact us [here](https://jekyllrb.com/) because we're looking for people like you to join us.

### Why Robinhood?

#### 1. Fast Transactions

Robinhood is creating blocks every 2 minutes, as opposed to every 10 minutes. Your money travels 5x faster on Robinhood than on Bitcoin.

#### 2. Privacy

Robinhood has the same privacy features you'll find in Monero and Aeon. Every transaction is private unless you choose to make it public.

#### 3. Easy To Use

We support almost every OS, even on mobile you can [make a secured paper-wallet for free](https://jekyllrb.com/), and get started with Robinhood in under 5 minutes.

#### 4. Easy To Mine

Robinhood comes with its own basic CPU miner, but you can also use any Monero mining software you're used to if you'd rather use GPU's or mining pools. We recommend XMR-Stak Unified Miner.

#### 5. Community

The Robinhood community is very welcoming to all users and developers. You won't get shouted at when things break, and we welcome critiques of our work. Please join us in our Telegram Chat.

#### 6. Support

We are growing a community of developers and testers in our GitHub meta-forum. You can help by testing software and submitting bug reports, or even just cheering us on from the sidelines.

### The story

Too many projects are bringing in **too much funding** despite most having **no damn product**. We figured, _"why not do the whole thing in reverse? Start with a fun project, make it as simple and accessible as possible, and let it grow on its own."_

We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, **the value will create itself**. If you think we're wrong, we're happy to [talk](https://jekyllrb.com/) about it.

### What is Robinhood

Robinhood is a fully secure and anonymous cryptocurrency. Built from the ground up to ensure anonymity, transactions cannot be linked to a single sender.

Cryptocurrency is about the decentralization of the financial sector, removing people’s dependence on third party institutions.

Robinhood is the natural next step in this journey, giving us all the power to make truly anonymous financial transactions.

#### Anonymous payments

Robinhood uses ring signatures and one-time addresses for truly anonymous payments.

#### Unlinkable transactions

Robinhood's transactions can't be linked between the sender and the recipient.

#### Egalitarian proof of work

Robinhood hash function is designed for egalitarian GPU & CPU mining.

#### Adaptive limits

Robinhood currency intelligently adjusts its parameters based on the historical data.
