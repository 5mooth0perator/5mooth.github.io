## Robinhood is people's electronic cash

Robinhood is cryptocurrency of Brazilian origin, just like Bitcoin but more anonymous and privacy centric with opaque and more analysis resistant blockchain.

It is people's electronic cash, not connected to government or officials.

### What is Robinhood

Robinhood is a fully secure and anonymous cryptocurrency. Built from the ground up to ensure anonymity, transactions cannot be linked to a single sender.

Cryptocurrency is about the decentralization of the financial sector, removing people’s dependence on third party institutions.

Robinhood is the natural next step in this journey, giving us all the power to make truly anonymous financial transactions.

### Robinhood features

#### Untraceable & Anonymous payments

CryptoNote uses ring signatures and one-time addresses for truly anonymous payments.

CryptoNote provides users with a completely anonymous payment scheme. CryptoNote implements the ring signature technology which allows you to sign a message on behalf of a group. The signature only proves the message was created by someone from the group, but all the possible signers are indistinguishable from each other.

#### Unlinkable transactions

CryptoNote's transactions can't be linked between the sender and the recipient.

Even if outgoing transactions are untraceable, everyone may still be able to see the payments you have received and thus determine your income. However, by using a variation of the Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol, a receiver has multiple unique one-time addresses derived from his single public key. After funds are sent to these addresses they can only be redeemed by the receiver; and it would be impossible to cross-link these payments.

#### Double-spending proof

Nobody is able to spend the same money twice — even if all his signatures are anonymous. Every signature contains a key image — a kind of fingerprint of the secret key. It is based on a one-way cryptographic function; this implies that given only the key image it is impossible to restore the corresponding secret key. These key images are used to prevent double-spending.

#### Blockchain analysis resistance

Non-repeating one-time addresses and mixed keys in ring signatures make the whole blockchain resistant to analysis. Each future transaction will only increase the entropy and create additional obstacles for an analyst.

#### Egalitarian proof of work

CryptoNight hash function is designed for egalitarian GPU & CPU mining.

The proof of work mechanism acts as a voting system. Thus, it is crucial that during the voting process all the participants have equal voting privileges. CryptoNote brings this equality with its egalitarian proof of work, utilizing built-in CPU instructions, which are very hard and too expensive to implement in special purpose devices, but perfectly suitable for ordinary PCs.

####  Adaptive parameters

CryptoNote currency intelligently adjusts its parameters based on the historical data.

A decentralized payment system must not depend on a single person's decisions, even if this person is a developer. CryptoNote has no hard-coded constants; magic numbers in the code are designed to be re-calculated based on the previous state of the network. Thus, they always change adaptively and independently, allowing the network to develop on its own.

### The corrupt fear us. The honest support us. The heroic join us. We are [#Robinhood](https://jekyllrb.com/)

We share the collective idea of people's electronic cash worldwide; we are the people.

We believe in non-violent, peaceful civil disobedience.

### The Nottinghamshire Blockchain Alliance

We predict that cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technologies like it will become far more significant over the next few years than is expected by most of our similarly irrelevant pundits — and this will, no doubt, turn out to be just as much of an understatement as anything else that has been written on the subject.

The Nottinghamshire Blockchain Alliance is a community was founded by 5mooth0perator in the county of Brazópolis, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

The Nottinghamshire Blockchain Alliance was formed to bring together people who are interested in getting involved in blockchain solutions.

The Nottinghamshire Blockchain Alliance community aims to help each other advance our ambitions in blockchain spaces.
